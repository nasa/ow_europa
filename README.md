This repository contains planetary models for OceanWATERS (Ocean
Worlds Autonomy Testbed for Exploration Research & Simulation).
Instructions for its installation and use are found in this project's
main repository, https://github.com/nasa/ow_simulator.

ow_europa
============
This repository contains models of mission sites on Europa. It is a separate
repository because it will potentially contain very large amounts of data that
we do not want to mix with smaller code repositories.

### atacama_y1a
This is currently the only model most users will use. It has high-res geometry
so that it can be modified by ow_dynamic_terrain. Eventually we want to expand
it to extend out to the horizon.

### terminator_workspace
Also a high-res model, `terminator_workspace` was a temporary model created
while we didn't have any other high-res terrain.

### terminator
The only model we currently have that extends to the horizon, this might be a
starting place for adding a high-res workspace where the lander can dig.

### test_dem
This model was used to test terrain modeling ideas, but it has no specific use
on its own.
